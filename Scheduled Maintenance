Scheduled Maintenance 

Scheduled Maintenance will be carried out on a regular basis to detect bugs, irregularities and identify any issues that can affect 
the game in any way and / or to reduce the risk of being hacked. We want to take responsibility but we will look to auditors to double 
check our gaming ecosystem is operating with the best industry standards. We may also employ other entities to help safe guard the game too.

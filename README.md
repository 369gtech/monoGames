Welcome to monoGames ecosystem!!!

monoGames is a blockchain play to earn gaming ecosystem which we hope to run on Signum Blockchain. We want to be an ecosystem where players, developers and investors can all participate and earn in unique ways. We understand the needs of players who love to play and earn, we understand developers who love to build games and we know how precious time is to investors. We want to create a balancing act so we all can build a sustainable evolutionary gaming ecosystem together.

Our first objective is to get gamers on board with the play to earn nft games we at monoGames create. Gamers will have the option to earn and hold or sell their rewards on the in game market or their faction (coin/token) market place. Factions are all the different coin(s)/token(s) communities that most players are already apart off. We want to bring those communities to monoGames to work together, build out together and fight together. Faction will include Signum, Ethereum, DOGE, Solana, Zill, Koinos, Hive, Wax and BSC to start with but this may change and also when the game starts to expand we will add more factions.

So how it will work is Players connect their current wallet(s) to log into the game, then the game automates their wallet(s) to the game wallet or if your new to blockchain gaming you will get the default in game wallet. The wallet(s) you have chosen will automate your profile to that faction(s) so if your an Ethereum wallet holder you are connected to the Ethereum Faction Community where you will be introduced to the Faction Leader, Faction Council Members, Faction Forum Lounge (social lounge) where the community hangs out, Portal Faction Land, your personal Comic Book, a set of faction guides to help you play, grow and improve your social standings to eventual have an opportunity to be a leader or council member. 

For players that hold more than one in game faction wallet and connects them to our game we will be giving players options to join more than one community with a special monoAvatar Matrix nft. We hope Factions create a really close knit community together especially when the whole community has to rely on one another to fulfill requirements to complete faction goals to help create new reward nft's for that faction which will be explained as the game expands.

We want to introduce monoGames Community Games where any developer(s) can build and introduce their games to the monoGames ecosystem. We would love to partner with any developer(s) and offer royalties earnt from the games they build so they get get paid for doing the job they love. There are Epic games which will come later like our Destiny Of Metaverse (Alpha monogames Metaverse) where we introduce some truly amazing game play while building a stronger community with increased player rewards.

We want investors to know we are an ever evolving ecosystem partnering with gamers and developers to build the next generation of fun to play and earn nft blockchain games where they can support the community with funding in return for royalties from the games they invest in. monoGames is more than building games we are about creating opportunities to give value for everyone in the ecosystem the way they want to earn while having fun along the journey. 

We want to incorporate tokenomics and governance tokens for a wide variety of in game possibilities. We want to give players inter-connectivity between gaming worlds with the idea a player can have flexibility and freedom to carry their investment from one game to another incorporating the true meaning of monoGames Metaverse. We are also connecting many Dapps like monoSol, our Community Social Media where you can connect, share and promote your monoAvatar Matrix and achievements 

We want to bring special features like monoTomicGold for special limited addition nft’s and special power up abilities, reward tokens like nftcryptomix for special nft reward packs which include exclusive reward nft’s, Portal Land Packages exclusively for each Faction to build out with exclusive staking nft’s which connect to your comic book and if your lucky to the main game comic book too, Top 10 Ranked Faction v’s Faction winner takes all competition with Super Rare Nft’s and Tokens and we have lots of other special features that will come as monoGames evolves.

Finally we are open to ideas and if you have any then please reach out to our <a href="https://discord.gg/5V4Y7y2gwV">discord</a> and let us know, we would love the feed back because monoGames is more than just games "were building a sustainable gaming ecosystem together with our ever evolving community".

This List is open to change as the project evolves and their is more community involvement in the direction of monoGames. If you would like to help then please feel free to head over to the monoGames <a href="https://discord.gg/5V4Y7y2gwV">discord</a> and we can talk about the role(s) you would to help with. All helpers would receive reward tokens, nft's and would probably be on the monoGames council where you will have an official role in our game.

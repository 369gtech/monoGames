Welcome to monoGames metaverse!!!

monoGames is a blockchain play to earn gaming ecosystem which we hope to run on Signum Blockchain but we do have monoFactions which connects you back to your favorite coin(s) and/or token(s) through a monoAvatar Matrix Portal. We are also connecting many Dapps like monoSol, our Community Social Media where you can connect, share and promote your monoAvatar Matrix.

To build out our gaming ecosystem we will bring out some basic Alpha Games to the community but we want the community to also have an opportunity to build games and add them to our gaming ecosystem in a partnership and royalty deal with monoGames. There are Epic games which will come later like our Destiny Of Metaverse (Alpha monogames Metaverse) where we introduce some truly amazing game play while building a stronger community with increased player rewards.

When you do start monoGames you start off with a monoAvatar, your special nft and a monoAvatar Matrix in which you choose your faction, place your nft’s and connects you to your portal faction land packages and your monoGames nft comic book for staking nft’s in your portal. We want to build a fair, player-centric path for players to build their ecosystem with their choosing so players have ownership of in game assets and become stake holders in the game. We want gamers to create value for themselves and monoGames from the time they join 24/7. We hope to add more special features as the game grows.

Our biggest emphasis we want to work on is building communities that work together, build out together and fight together in the faction(s) you join. We will be giving players options to join more than one community with special monoAvatar Matrix nft’s. Also if you have special nft’s you may be legible to be on the faction council to earn even bigger rewards, help other players with rewarding their involvement in the game and helping to steer the direction of the game.

We want to incorporate tokenomics and governance tokens for a wide variety of in game possibilities. We want to give players inter-connectivity between gaming worlds with the idea a player can have flexibility and freedom to carry their investment and achievements from one game to another incorporating the true meaning of monoGames Metaverse.

We want to bring special features like monoTomicGold for special limited addition nft’s and special power up abilities, reward tokens like nftctyptomix for special nft reward packs which include exclusive reward nft’s, Portal Land Packages exclusively for each Faction to build out with exclusive staking nft’s which connect to your comic book and if your lucky to the main game comic book, Top 10 Ranked Faction v’s Faction winner takes all competition with Super Rare Nft’s and Tokens and we have lots of other special features that will come with time.

This is the list of ideas and projects I envision for monoGames:

This List is open to change as the project evolves and their is more community involvement in the direction of monoGames. If you would like to help then please feel free to head over to the monoGames <a href="https://discord.gg/GUPh9PK8">discord</a> and we can talk about the role(s) you would to help with. All helpers would receive reward tokens, nft's and would probably be on the monoGames council where you will have an official role in our game.

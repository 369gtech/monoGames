Welcome to monoGames a blockchain multiplayer NFT game ecosystem with Play2Earn (<a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Alpha-monoGames">Alpha</a>/<a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Beta-monoGames">Beta</a>/<a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Destiny-Of-The-Universe-Game-Prologue">DOU</a>), Interactive Social2Earn (<a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoGames-Social-Lounge-monoSol-">monoSol</a>/<a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoGames-Social-Media-monoMedia-">monoMedia</a>) and Interactive Sustainable2Earn (<a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoGames-Sustainability-monoGreen-">monoGreen</a>). In monoGames you can buy, sell, trade, gift and in some instances rent NFT’s. All NFT holders will be able to play, stake and earn rewards in many ways. It combines a gaming Metaverse experience with Real World Interaction while creating a passive income. monoGames hopes to run on Signum Blockchain but there will initially be 12 blockchains apart of monoGames which includes Signum, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, DOGE, Pirate Chain, Dragonchain, Koinos, Hive, Wax, BSC and Zill. All blockchains will be represented as <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Faction</a> within monoGames, have a token connected to monoGames, teams in Destiny Of The Universe and more as will be discussed in the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/White-Paper">White Paper</a>.

We want to be an ecosystem where players, developers and investors can all participate and earn in unique ways. We understand the needs of players who love to play and earn, we understand developers who love to build games and we know how precious time is to investors. We want to create a balancing act so we all can build a sustainable evolutionary gaming ecosystem together.

Our first objective is to get gamers on board with the Play2Earn, Interactive Social2Earn and Interactive Sustainable2Earn gaming ecosystem. Most players who come to monoGames are already apart of the blockchain ecosystem and are vary loyal to their respective blockchain communities they belong too. We want to initially bring 12 blockchain communities together and create <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Factions</a> where those blockchain communities work together, build together and fight together against other <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Factions</a>. Also when the game starts to expand we will add more blockchain communities in accordance with the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Tokenomics">Tokenomics</a> of the game with the monoGames community having the ability to vote those new blockchain communities in.

So how it will work is Players connect their current wallet(s) to log into the game, then the game automates their wallet(s) to the game wallet or if your new to blockchain gaming you will get the default in game wallet (Signum). The wallet(s) you have chosen will automate your profile to that <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Faction</a>(s) so if your an Ethereum wallet holder you are connected to the Ethereum Faction Community where you will be introduced to the Faction Leader, Faction Higher Council Members, Faction Council Members, Faction Social Lounge where the community hangs out, limited addition lounge rooms, your personal Comic Book, a set of faction guides to help you play, grow and improve your social standing with in monoGames.

For players that hold more than one in game <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Faction</a> wallet and connects them to our game, we will be giving players options to join more than one community with a special <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoAvatar-Matrix">monoAvatar Matrix</a> NFT. We hope Factions create a really close knit community together especially when the whole community has to rely on one another to fulfill requirements to complete Faction goals to help create new reward NFT's for that Faction which will be explained as the game expands.

We want to introduce monoGames Community Games (<a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Alpha-monoGames">Alpha</a>/<a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Beta-monoGames">Beta</a>/<a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoGames-Expansion">Expansion</a>) where any developer(s) can build, maintain and introduce their games to the monoGames ecosystem. Part of the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Tokenomics">Tokenomics</a> of monoGames is we have funds available over 5 years which will be paid daily to developers who build, maintain and introduce games. There will be special requirements from developers that will be outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/White-Paper">White Paper</a> that they must agree too, to help keep monoGames sustainable with investors. We hope developers build some truly amazing games for players so we can create a really strong community.

We want Whale Investors and Player Investors to know we are an ever evolving ecosystem partnering with gamers and developers to build the next generation of fun to play and earn interactive sustainable NFT blockchain games where they can support the community by staking large amounts of Faction Tokens and nftcryptomix Tokens for daily rewards issued in the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Tokenomics">Tokenomics</a> of the game, NFT packs, land packages, all NFT's at max level for whale investors, all NFT's at epic level for all player investors and special privileges. Remember these tokens will be staked for 5 years but you can sell your rights to others players should you choose too.

We want to give players inter-connectivity between gaming worlds with the idea a player can have flexibility and freedom to carry their investment from one game to another incorporating the true meaning of monoGames Metaverse. We have also incorporated two social media platforms that we hope will innovate the connectivity within the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Factions</a> which includes the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoGames-Social-Lounge-monoSol-">monoGames Social Lounge</a> (monoSol) and <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoGames-Social-Media-monoMedia-">monoGames Social Media</a> (monoMedia) our Community Social Media Networks where you can connect, share and promote your Metaverse to the world.

We want to bring special features like monoTomicGold for special limited addition NFT’s, special power up abilities, reward tokens like nftcryptomix for special NFT reward packs which include exclusive reward NFT’s (Diamond NFT's), limited addition lounge rooms exclusively for each <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Faction</a> in their respective <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/monoGames-Social-Lounge-monoSol-">monoGames Social Lounge</a> (monoSol) to build out with exclusive staking NFT’s which connect to your comic book and if your lucky to the main game comic book too, Top 10 Ranked Faction v’s Faction winner takes all competition with Super Rare NFT’s and Tokens and we have lots of other special features that will come as monoGames expands.

Finally we are open to ideas and if you have any then please reach out to our <a href="https://discord.gg/5V4Y7y2gwV">discord</a> and let us know, we would love the feed back because monoGames is more than just games "were building a sustainable gaming ecosystem together with our ever evolving community".

This List is open to change as the project evolves and their is more community involvement in monoGames. If you would like to help then please feel free to head over to the monoGames <a href="https://discord.gg/5V4Y7y2gwV">discord</a> and we can talk about the role(s) you would like to help with. All helpers would receive reward tokens, NFT's and would probably be on the monoGames council where you will have an official role in our game.
